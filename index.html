      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>Since leaving highschool, I have had somewhat of a diverse background. It began with 3 years of university followed by a 5-year Navy enlistment. Upon departing the military, I entered a career in law enforcement that last about 5 years until i decided to leave due to an unfulfilled occupation. From then I owned a lawn care business, worked in the oilfield, and various other odd jobs. I have now recently discoverd a my passion of computer technology, and more specifically, software development. I am now all-in with the education and training required to enter this field and make a complete career change.
